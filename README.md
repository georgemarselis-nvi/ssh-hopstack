Generic SSH connection library supporting arbitrary jump chains with per-hop authentication (keys, keyboard-interactive 2FA, GSSAPI/Kerberos) and strict hostkey validation.
Built on Paramiko, structured around transport orchestration and pluggable auth strategies, not SSH CLI emulation.
Targets bastions, HPC and locked-down enterprise environments.
